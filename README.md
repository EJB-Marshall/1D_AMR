# 1D_AMR
A toy python code to run Berger-Colella Style AMR (i.e. with refluxing). Many implementation ideas were taken from the codes of Ian Hawke (https://github.com/IanHawke/toy-amr, https://github.com/IanHawke/amr1d) and Justin Ripley (https://github.com/JLRipley314/one-dim-amr).

PDEs are defined simulation classes, e.g. Burgers_AMR.py. Once you have created the class, you can run the simulation with a setup file, e.g. Setup_Burgers_AMR.py.

It is very possible there are errors in the code, please let me know if you find anything.
